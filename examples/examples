Please bring some examples of work you have done â€“ this could be URLs that we can review together or sample code, etc.

"revenue-wire mock-up"
http://afable.github.io/dailys/
- I would browse the web and try to recreate websites I find.

"witchr - passion project"
https://witchr.github.io/
- Something I come back to every now and then. I wanted to create a 3D puzzle platformer that had a horror theme.
- More a proof of concept that THREE.js was enough to enable website that was an actual video game < 5MB in size.
- Something that could be played on any device (tablet, mobile, pc, console, etc.) and something I wanted to make from just javascript.
- Current size of in-game models, textures, and js files (including main game routine, THREE.js 3D library, and cannon.js physics engine) is < 3MB. Sounds and other stuff push past it.
- Still thinking of ways to reduce the filesize of the sound files, and I've though about breaking down full length audio tracks into very short sound bytes that melodically repeat and loop varying sounds at different intervals to create a full background track (like how people use pedal Loop Recorders to create songs).
- Go over main.js breakdown...

afable.github.io & misc. projects (quotr, etc.)
http://afable.github.io/
- I wanted to checkout jquery mobile 3.
- It does make things a bit easier but you have to learn how the jquery library works. It seems like CSS3 and vanilla JS is getting closer to the point of being able to make these polished transitions, animations, and tweens without a steep learning curve. So my next iteration of my website will probably just be in plain JS, unless there's a new web framework that comes out that I'm interested in learning.
- This is normally how I learn most things... like frameworks (e.g. bootstrap, jquery) and tools such as flow (for js syntax checking) and javascript minimizer (for minifying and obscuring your js code)...

EBC Voter Services Resource Centre (offline)
127.0.0.1/
- Local voter services resource centre for enabling non-developers to use an offline website and microsoft word to create their manuals.

firebase & npm
ssh server
- Currently trying to setup a webserver using Google's Firebase stack.
