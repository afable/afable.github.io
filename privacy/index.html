		<p>At Afable, we do not collect, use or disclose your personal information but we do provide our games through third party app stores and app marketplaces which may collect, use or disclose your personal  information.</p>

		<p>We will inform you of why and how we collect, use and disclose your personal information, obtain your consent where required, and only handle your personal information in a manner that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
		<p>This Personal Information Protection Policy, in compliance with PIPA, outlines the principles and practices we will follow in protecting your personal information.
